# Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone Project

This is a terminal project I did to earn the [Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate.](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics)

The project is divided into two (2) parts:

* Salifort Motors Churn Prediction Model Development

* Waze Churn Prediction Model Development

<br>

## Salifort Motors Churn Prediction

### Project Description and Overview

The goal of the project is to predict which employees are more likely to quit Salifort Motors.

The project is based on a certain [HR_capstone_dataset](resources/HR_capstone_dataset.csv) provided in CSV format.

### Executing The Project and deliverables

The project was done according to the [PACE strategy document](resources/PACE-strategy-document.pdf) provided as a guide.

The technical aspect of the project (the coding) was done in a [Python environment.](deliverables/lab.ipynb)

The findings and insights are provided in an [Executive Summary](deliverables/Executive-Summary.pdf) PDF document.

Finally on this, the models employed are saved in the [models](models) directory of this repository.

## Waze User Churn Prediction Project

The goal of this project is to predict which users are more likely to churn given the data provided and which features are most important in predicting churn.

### Project overview and description

The project is based on a certain [waze_dataset.csv](waze-churn/waze_dataset.csv) file

The project is broken into 6 phases:

* Phase 1 - The [Project Proposal](waze-churn/phase-1-Project-Proposal.pdf) and [PACE Strategy Document](waze-churn/phase-1-PACE-Strategy-Document.pdf) for guidelines

* Phase 2 - [PACE Strategy Document](waze-churn/phase-2-PACE-Strategy-Document.pdf), [lab environment](waze-churn/phase-2-lab.ipynb), and [Executive Summary](waze-churn/phase-2-Executive-summary.pdf)

* Phase 3 - [PACE Strategy Document](waze-churn/phase-3-PACE-strategy-document.pdf), [lab environment](waze-churn/phase-3-lab.ipynb), and [Executive Summary](waze-churn/phase-3-Executive-summary.pdf)

* Phase 4 - [PACE Strategy Document](waze-churn/phase-4-PACE-Strategy-Document.pdf), [lab environment](waze-churn/phase-4-lab.ipynb), and [Executive Summary](waze-churn/phase-4-Executive-summary.pdf)

* Phase 5 - [PACE Strategy Document](waze-churn/phase-5-PACE-strategy-document.pdf), [lab environment](waze-churn/phase-5-lab.ipynb), and [Executive Summary](waze-churn/phase-5-Executive-summary.pdf)

* Phase 6 - [PACE Strategy Document](waze-churn/phase-6-PACE-strategy-document.pdf), [lab environment](waze-churn/phase-6-lab.ipynb), and [Executive Summary](waze-churn/phase-6-Executive-summary.pdf)
